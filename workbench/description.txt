Small mod that adds a cannon turret that can use specially manufactured tank shell magazine ammunitions.
- Good range (30 vs 18 for laser turrets) but a big minimum range too.
- Low rate of fire and rotation.
- Special munitions that don't collide like tanks shells
- Shells are homing (good against single target), explosive shells target position (good against grouped ennemies).
- Watch out for friendly fire still !
- Custom shooting sound : https://instaud.io/1Cm2

The goal of this mod was to make a different turret using tank shells but still close to Vanilla. Unfortunatly there is no way to keep a colliding projectile ammunition that does not friendly fire collision for now. So turret projectiles are homing on entities for normal shells or target a position for explosive shells which is not accurate but balanced with splash damage on grouped ennemies.

Inspiration from an old 0.12 turret mod : https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=14957 and sprite by the talented modder YuokiTani.
